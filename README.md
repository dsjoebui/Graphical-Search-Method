# Graphical-Search-Method

This interactive graph is used as a way to filter and select scientific publications. This project was inspired by the time consuming task of literature review. This is propogated through the current search method of a list view when searching for papers on journal websites, which can be daunting when going through thousands of papers. To present the data in a condensed, organized manner, the graph was set up to sort papers by the number of times a paper is cited and by the relevance to keywords or articles input by the user. The goal is to ultimately provide researchers with a way to more efficiently screen papers and possibly provide an insight on the metadata. The data used in this graph was webscraped from PubMed, using the search term, lung cancer. As a disclaimer, this project is intended only as an academic capstone-project and not for any commercial use.

To run a local server and open the app, run the file, `plotlydash.py`, and a URL to the webpage will be outputted.

The data was webscraped from Pubmed using the search term: 'Lung Cancer'.

This project is still in progress.
